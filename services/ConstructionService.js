/**
* Get Transaction Construction Metadata
* Get any information required to construct a transaction for a specific network. Metadata returned here could be a recent hash to use, an account sequence number, or even arbitrary chain state. It is up to the client to correctly populate the options object with any network-specific details to ensure the correct metadata is retrieved.  It is important to clarify that this endpoint should not pre-construct any transactions for the client (this should happen in the SDK). This endpoint is left purposely unstructured because of the wide scope of metadata that could be required.  In a future version of the spec, we plan to pass an array of Rosetta Operations to specify which metadata should be received and to create a transaction in an accompanying SDK. This will help to insulate the client from chain-specific details that are currently required here.
